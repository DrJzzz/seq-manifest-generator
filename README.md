# Sequence Manifest Generator

This script generates a manifest containing the sequence name, the sequence path, and the orientation of the sequence.

The input is a directory path that contains sequences and only sequences.

The output will be a manifext.csv inside the same directory.


Example use:
```python manifest-generator.py <path_to_dir>```
